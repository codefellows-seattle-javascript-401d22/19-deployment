===

## Requirements
Create a function that accepts an array of integers as it's input.  Your function should find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is defined by incrementing *n - 1* elements *by 1*.

For example, given the following array, only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

```javascript
// given:
let nums = [1,2,3];
minMoves(nums);

// return:
3

// explanation of result:
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```

## Submission Instructions

1. With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
1. Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
1. This folder should contain:
  - A file named `solution.js` which contains the JavaScript solution
  - A `__test__` directory that includes your `solution.test.js` file and associated tests
  - A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
  - A `README.md` which includes the problem domain
1. Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional
1. Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch
1. Submit a link to your PR on Canvas or submit a link to your `repo/daily-whiteboarding-directory/solution.js`
